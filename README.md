# polyview

A simple multiple alignment viewer witten in Rust, using notcurses.

It's a very simple application, bugs, crashes and unexpected behaviour WILL happen. The code is messy, hacky and has a bunch of hard coded values in it. It also only appropriately colours DNA... RNA and peptide colouring needs to be added.

I wrote it one day when I came across notcurses and thought it would be fun to make a terminal based alignment viewer. I probably won't finish it as there isnt any real purpose for it.
